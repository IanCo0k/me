So I’ve recently developed a liking to reading. For the first time since, I don’t know, 6th grade. When it was required of me. I went out to lunch with one of my good friends and he gifted me a few of his books for Christmas. The one I am currently reading is called Live No Lies by John Mark Comer. It has genuinely changed my life already. I actually haven’t even finished yet, but I wanted to reflect on a few things.

<br />
<br />

I am making a promise to myself that I won’t read up any summaries on this book or anything to guide this blog, so if what I’m saying isn’t the consensus interpretation of this book, than I’d love to know why. Text me or something and tell me why. But anyways, here’s what has stood out to me.
<br />
<br />

So I feel it’s probably necessary to make one thing clear. I am follower of Jesus. I have come to the conclusion that Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, came into the world and lived a perfect life and died on the cross to satisfy the wrath of God and to bring forgiveness of sin and to reconcile our relationship with God. I believe that He defeated death when He rose again on the 3rd day and I am now offered a new life in Christ by accepting that sacrifice.
<br />
<br />

In accepting Jesus as my savior, His spirit now resides within me. The Spirit of the Creator of the universe lives within me. Crazy. And that Spirit has set me free! Like Paul says in 2 Corinthians, I am a new creation. Who I once was and who I am now are effectively two different people.
<br />
<br />

But here’s the reality: I still struggle with sin. More than I would like to admit. My flesh is still constantly at war with the Spirit that lives within me. Following Jesus requires a constant decision to choose the will of the Spirit over the will of our flesh. But it’s hard!! It sometimes feels near impossible. But it’s not impossible. 1 Corinthians 10:13 tells us that God always provides a way out. Sometimes you just have to look.
<br />
<br />

That sounds so simple, but I know it’s not that cut and dry. But this book has literally changed the entire way that I view this battle that goes on within us.
<br />
<br />

The devil is referred to in many ways, and one that paints one of the more violent images comes in 1 Peter, where we are told that “Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour”. The devil doesn’t want us to find freedom in Christ. He wants to hunt you down and devour you and diminish your ability to find freedom; to find the truth. And the devil combats the truth with lies. Each time you give in to sin, you are choosing to believe a lie. You are choosing something that is contrary to reality. Take any sin, and put it to this test. I guarantee it checks out.
<br />
<br />

Here’s out this has impacted my life directly, and maybe it can apply to you too. Anytime you feel tempted, or just feel drawn away from what you know God is calling you to. Recognize it for what it is. A lie from the devil. And the best way to combat these lies is with truth. And Jesus is truth. So take that as you will.
<br />
